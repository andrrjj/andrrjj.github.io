      <em>Julia: A Lesbian</em> was a play co-created by <a href='https://www.toothnfang.com/' class='external_link' target='_blank'>Allanah Avalon and Nathalie Kozak</a> as their joint undergraduate thesis production. I worked as the sound designer and musical advisor for the project. My contributions included: music research and soundtrack curation; composition of &quot;Julia&apos;s Theme&quot;; diagetic sound and music; selection of monitors for the performance; testing and calibration of the sound in the performance space; the creation of a performance cuefile in QueLab; and running the audio for the show.

      <em>Julia</em> was debuted in Abu Dhabi at the <a href='https://www.nyuad-artscenter.org/' class='external_link' target='_blank'>NYUAD Arts Center</a>'s Black Box Theatre, and then performed at Speakeasy HQ as part of the <a href='https://melbournefringe.com.au/event/julia-a-lesbian/' class='external_link' target='_blank'>Melbourne Fringe Festival 2018</a>, in Australia.

      Working on <em>Julia</em> was a little challenge for myself. I was aware from the start that thematically and aesthetically, the project would be quite out of line from the work I have typically done. I was particularly interested in the requriement for a theme-song in the style of a romantic comedy or sitcom. This was not something that I had done before, and I was curious about how the process of creating such a song would play out.
