      One walks into a museum and is confronted with art. &quot;Why is this art? I could have made it.&quot; It is seemingly mundane and seemingly reproducible only until afforded its worth by a cultural elite. Through this process of meaning-making by a privileged and bourgeois few, art tends to sit in the realm of influence and excess.
<br><br>
Thus it is only accessible to those who bestow upon it its value. The position of the artist and and art&apos;s consumers, here, is that of the elite, those with surplus amounts of money and resources, which enabling the artification of the mundane. Is it possible for art to exist outside of this framework?
<br><br>
In the capitalistic system of economy and market value, how is the worth of art measured if not by the seemingly arbitrary matrix of calculation spear-headed by the few elite? What then is the responsibility of the artist? Is the independent artist but a myth&#63;
<br><br>
Outside of the elite, exists a visible and growing working class whose lives are completely driven by economy &#45; rate of work, efficiency, utility; the omnipresent spheres of industry and consumerism penetrating into even the domestic landscape. &quot;Who has time and money for art when we barely have time and money to eat, to survive?&quot;
<br><br>
Having established these questions regarding the contemporary system of production and ascribed meaning, <em>Ascribing Meaning to a Domestic Act</em> offers a response to them. By presenting the artist herself in the mundane and domestic act of cooking and consuming food, <em>Ascribing Meaning to a Domestic Act</em> argues that the act of making the piece is the protest in itself, partaking in a process in which only the elite are afforded participation. Here, the artists embrace the meta-aesthetic of the mundane non-art artwork, and deeming this art, art. The system, with its harsh machine-like qualities, remains however, never too far away. It is omnipresent, and invasive &#45; manifested in an industrial soundscape which treads between delusion and the quotidien.

    This piece was a collaboration with <a class="external_link" target="_blank" href="http://salberwilliams.com">Salber Williams</a> who filmed the video footage and sequenced the video. I created the soundscape using mostly industrial field recordings sourced from <a class="external_link" target="_blank" href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound.org</a>, and manipulated in Logic.
