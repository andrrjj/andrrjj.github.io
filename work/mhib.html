      <em>My House is Burning</em> is a theatre piece conceived and created by <a href='https://salberwilliams.com/' class='external_link' target='_blank'>Salber Lee Williams</a> for her capstone project in 2017. I contributed sound design and musical direction to the project. My work involved collecting and editing the musical source material needed for the production, as well as composing and creating new sound pieces &#40;a sample of which can be heard in the links below&#41;. My sound pieces, like the &quot;Climax&quot; below, were created using a combination of found, recorded, and synthesized sound.
      <br><br>
      I extended my involvement beyond the production phase, also creating the Quelab files, and running the audio &#40;and projections&#41; during the show.
