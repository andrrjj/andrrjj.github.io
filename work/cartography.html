    <p class="review"><b><i>"Technology, for example, becomes not a gimmick but a way to echo elements of the refugee experience"</i></b>. &#45; The National, UAE, June 2018</p>
    <p>
      <!-- <br><br> -->
      <em>Cartography</em> is a theatrical work created by <a class='external_link' target='_blank' href='http://kanezaschaal.com/works/cartography/'>Kaneza Schaal</a> and <a class='external_link' target='_blank' href='https://www.kalyban.com/'>Christopher Myers</a> that explores themes of geography, displacement, and tracing personal narratives of refugee youth in the context; beginnings, endings, and the journeys in between. Cartography leverages interactive technologies to involve audience members in experiencing and understanding the scale and trajectories of displacement. The piece unfolds in a reactive sound environment in which elements of the performersâ€™ voices give life to the character of The Ocean - at times stormy, at times tranquil - an ever-present witness and medium to the characters&apos; journeys and fates. The piece was co-commissioned by The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and The Arts Center at NYU Abu Dhabi.

      <br><br>
      As part of the development of the piece, the artists undertook a two weeklong creative residency at the <a class='external_link' target='_blank' href='https://www.nyuad-artscenter.org/'>NYU Abu Dhabi Arts Center</a> in June 2018 to workshop creative technologies that they wanted to use in <em>Cartography</em>. As a recent graduate, I was selected to work as part of the creative development team under the Interactive Media Department. I focused on developing a reactive sound environment where different sonic elements of the performance &#40;loudness, pitch, rate of speech&#41; could be used to control, in realtime, a projection of an ocean storm.

      A work-in-progress demonstration of the tools we developed was performed at the Arts Center at the end of the residency, and the piece was debuted in a complete form at the <a class='external_link' target='_blank' href='http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/event/KTTAB#tickets'>John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a> in Washington D.C. in January 2019. The finished work returns to the <a class='external_link' target='_blank' href='https://www.nyuad-artscenter.org/en_US/events/2020/cartography-kaneza-schaal-and-christopher-myers/'>NYUAD Arts Center</a> in February 2020.

      The audio-reactive ocean system was built in <b><u>Max</u></b> and <b><u>Isadora</u></b>, and makes heavy use of OSC communication between the two programs to co-ordinate audio processing in Max and its relation to the ocean&apos;s behavior in Isadora. Along with this, we developed an OSC user control interface for a smoother experience running the show, and making changes to the presets.
