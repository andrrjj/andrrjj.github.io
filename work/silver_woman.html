      <em>A Woman in Silver</em> is a piece created by <a href='https://salberwilliams.com/' class='external_link' target='blank'>Salber Williams</a> that works as both a performance and an audio-visual installation. It was performed as part of the 2019 edition of the <a href='https://48-stunden-neukoelln.de/de/event/woman-silver' class='external_link' target='blank'>48h Neuk&ouml;ln Festival</a> in Berlin, Germany at <a href='https://werkstadt.berlin/en/events/a-woman-in-silver' class='external_link' target='blank'>Werkstadt Berlin</a>. The artist&apos;s description of the project reads:
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="quotation">
        Afrofuturistic iconography, Frantz Fanon&apos;s seminal essay: <i>The Fact of Blackness</i>, submerged in an ominous percussive soundscape, and the body of a woman of color cycling through a series of rigorous physical phrases. This durational performance piece offers a way into the black subconscious, specifically that of the black woman, through physically manifesting both the challenges and celebrations of the past and the near and far future. How far have we actually come?
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      For this project, rather than creating a traditional soundscape to serve as more of a background to the visual elements that would be happening, we thought about creating a "track"; a more formal and structured dance techno-scape that does more than embed the performance in sound. We wanted sound that gave a structure and arc to the visual elements; that at times took precedence, and that at other times took a back seat.
      <br><br>
      We decided that I should create something rhythmic, almost club-like, that incites movement to contrast the &quot;stillness&quot; of the performer&apos;s body. The timbres and dynamics should be in dialogue with the content and nature of the spoken word. We aimed to create an uncomfortable contrast between the subject matter and the music&apos;s danceability and an incessant pulsing rhythm to mirror the narrator's incessant struggle.
